# DefuseIt-MobileGame
A remastered version of a mobile game I created a long time ago.

## This Project Contains:
- I have included an APK for those that want to test the application on their android phones.
- I have included the Unity Engine Project that is compatible with v2017.3.0f3

## Usage:
- Open the project in any version of Unity > v2017.1
- The engine will automatically rebuild the asset database and library folders, dont worry about this and just let it do its thing.
- Let the project compile and you should be good to go!

### Side Note:
- All my scripts are in the Assets/My Scripts/ directory.
- This project is written in C# and uses Mono to port to Android/iOS
